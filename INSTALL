Installation
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾

Installation procedures were tested under 64-bit Ubuntu. In principle, it should
be possible to install the fastcluster package on any system that has a C++
compiler and R respectively Python with NumPy.  There are no unusual libraries
needed to compile the package, only the STL library, which every C++ compiler
should have by default.

Please send me feedback if you accomplish to install the fastcluster package
under a different operating system from Linux or if you had to tweak the
configuration!  I will the update the installation instructions and modify the
package if needed (eg.  include the right compiler flags for various operating
systems).


Installation for R
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Open a terminal, go to the directory with the downloaded archive file and type:

  R CMD INSTALL fastcluster_1.0.2.tar.gz

You may need to precede the above command with sudo to gain administrator
privileges. There are ways to install R packages without administrator
privileges in your user directories. See this help page for example:

  http://csg.sph.umich.edu/docs/R/localpackages.html

If you need further help with the installation procedure, please consult R's
help function by typing ?INSTALL from within R.


Installation for Python
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Make sure that you have Python and NumPy installed. Open a terminal, go to the
directory with the downloaded file and extract the contents of the archive with:

    tar -xvf fastcluster_1.0.2.tar.gz

This will generate a new directory fastcluster. Switch to its python
subdirectory:

    cd fastcluster/python/

Now compile and install the Python module by:

    python setup.py install

Again, you may need to precede this command with sudo or install the package in
your home directory. For example, the line

    python setup.py install --home=~

installs the package in the path lib/python/ under your home directory. See the
chapter “Installing Python modules” in the Python documentation for further
help.
